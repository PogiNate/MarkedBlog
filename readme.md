MarkedBlog
==========

## (Yet Another) Static Blog generator, but this time with *style*.

MarkedBlog is my whack at a simple way to create static websites from good ol' MultiMarkdown.

##Whyyyyyyy? Aren't there enough of these already?

Well, probably. Which means it's an idea whose time has come. I'm just adding my two cents to the conversation and mixing metaphors like a house on fire.

Our main differentiators are the tools we choose: MarkedBlog uses [MulitMarkdown][mmd] instead of regular Markdown or Github-Flavored Markdown, uses [LESS][less] instead of Liquid, and basically is built according to the defaults I want in my static blog creator. (At least, it will, once I'm done with it. Right now *It Doesn't Do Anything!*&trade;)

##Features?

Oh, you bet we'll have features!

MarkedBlog will use all the greatest technologies and frameworks, including amazing things like:

* [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org)!
* [HTML5Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)!
* [GLI](http://davetron5000.github.com/gli/)!
* [Less][less]!
* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)!
* and many more! Probably!

All to give you the fastest, most responsive way to make a bunch of HTML documents that you can then host on the cheap.
